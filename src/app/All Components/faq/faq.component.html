                    Car bidding is a competitive process where individuals place bids on vehicles being auctioned. The auction can be conducted in person at a physical location or online. Bidders compete to offer the highest price for the vehicle they wish to purchase. The highest bid at the end of the auction wins, and the vehicle is sold to that bidder.
